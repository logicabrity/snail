= snail

snail is an interactive IRC client in an early phase of development.
Nothing to see here, move along!

= usage

see
  ruby bin/snail.rb -h

or have a .snail.config in your home directory
that looks like this:
  server:
    - host
    - port
  user: yourusername
  password: yourpassword

The options are not optional...
Oh, and after the connection registration, you're on your own
when it comes to the IRC protocol.
